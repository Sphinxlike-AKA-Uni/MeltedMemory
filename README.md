# MeltedMemory
Glitch Art Script

##### Just a simple script that uses an (incomplete) heap sort algorithm with the arrays of pixels of an image or gif

# Usage
```
./MeltedMemory <filename>
```
#### Alternative: On windows you can drag an image to the exe icon within file explorer and will even place the output image to that directory
